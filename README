project summary for dosbox-pykde

dosbox-pykde
A dosbox frontend written in PyKDE.  Rather than concentrating on dosbox configuration 
management over multiple games, this frontend concentrates on file management.  This 
frontend is designed to separate the freshly installed files from the changed file, configuration 
files, and saved games.  Every game entry in the frontend is split between two different 
archives.  The first archive is a zipfile created upon entry to the frontend.  This is meant to save 
a fresh install.  The secondary, or extras archive, is a tarball whose contents are generated 
from an rdiff-backup of the leftover or changed files relative to the install archive.  Extra 
development time is being spent on providing comments throughout the code, as a way of 
providing an example of the use of PyKDE.  There is very little PyKDE code to peruse on the 
internet, and there is also little documentation available.  Hopefully this application will double 
as a "tutorial" for those who wish to program in PyKDE, but do not want to learn C++ in order 
to understand how to use it.
